#Todo List 
This is a simple todo list which is created using React js and LocalStorage.
## Getting Started
I have built a todo app using reactjs and i am storing it in local storage for persistence of data.
## Components 
There are 5 Components in this project. Among them Display and Done component is the main component.
1.Display Component: It is use to display all the items.
2.done Component: Once i  Click sendToDone option in display component it is going to Done component and here we can perform  the delete operation.
## What I have built
1. Display the list of items that is entered in input field.
2. I can edit and send those items to Done Component.
3. I can drag and drop items in display component.
4. Finally, I can delete items in Done Component.
5.I used localStorage So that if the page is refreshed then the data is not loss . Same data is displayed in the screen if it is refreshed.
